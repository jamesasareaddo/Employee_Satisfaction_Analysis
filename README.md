Employee satisfaction is a critical factor influencing job performance, particularly in the healthcare sector. This study examines the relationship between employee satisfaction and job performance among healthcare professionals. The analysis explores key factors such as perceived value, compensation, organizational culture, and motivation levels to determine how they impact job performance.

## **Objective & Research Questions**
### **Objective:**
To analyze how employee satisfaction influences job performance in healthcare centers and identify key factors contributing to job satisfaction.

### **Research Questions:**
1. Is there a correlation between employee satisfaction and job performance?
2. How do factors like compensation, work-life balance, and managerial support affect job satisfaction?
3. What role does organizational culture play in shaping job satisfaction and performance?

## **Dataset Description**
The dataset consists of **80 responses** from healthcare professionals across different roles, including nurses, doctors, physician assistants, and administrative staff. The data includes **demographic details**, **job satisfaction levels**, **self-reported job performance**, and **workplace environment perceptions**.

### **Key Variables in the Dataset:**

- **Job Performance Metrics:** Self-rated performance, motivation levels, feedback frequency
- **Organizational Factors:** Communication effectiveness, work climate, and cultural alignment

## **Analytical Approach**
To standardize responses, we converted categorical variables into **Likert scale values (1-5)**:

| **Category**             | **Scale (1-5)**              |
|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| Very Dissatisfied      | 1                          |
| Dissatisfied          | 2                          |
| Neutral               | 3                          |
| Satisfied             | 4                          |
| Very Satisfied        | 5                          |

### **Methods Used:**
✅ **Data Cleaning & Transformation:** Standardized categorical responses using Likert scales.  
✅ **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculated means, medians, and frequency distributions.  
✅ **Correlation Analysis:** Explored the relationship between job satisfaction and performance.  
✅ **Data Visualization:** Used bar charts and heatmaps to analyze trends.  

## **Key Findings & Insights**
### **1. Employee Satisfaction Correlates with Job Performance**
